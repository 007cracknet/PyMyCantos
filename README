This is a command line utility using python to send free sms using mycantos.com.
It was inspired by curl as a tweet from terminal application. 

User should have a valid mycantos account for sending sms. One has to enter his 
username and password when prompted. Rest will be done by program itself. Main feature
is to avoid unnecessary browser loading and it's really handy to reply quickly. ;)

Comments on any bugs are deeply appreciated.
